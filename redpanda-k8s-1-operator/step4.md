Updating and patching a Redpanda cluster is fairly straightforward with Helm.
You can use the parameter, like how you deployed the cluster at the beginning of the tutorial, or you can create a YAML file with the new settings.

In this step, you add and spin up Redpanda Console. Redpanda Console is a developer-friendly UI for managing your workloads. You've enabled the console to deploy as well as set up an ingress endpoint, so you can access the console externally.  

![Redpanda console overview](./images/step-4-overview.png)

```
cat <<EOF > value.yaml
console:
  enabled: true
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
    - paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: ImplementationSpecific
EOF
```{{exec}}


To kick start Helm and upgrade a release with the new changes in setting, run:

```
helm upgrade --install redpanda redpanda/redpanda \
    --namespace redpanda --create-namespace \
    --values value.yaml --reuse-values

```{{exec}}


Give it a minute or two, and your console should be deployed and ready. 

```
kubectl -n redpanda get pod
```{{exec}}


You see the redpanda-console Pod running. 

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
redpanda-0                          1/1     Running     0          2m29s
redpanda-configuration-w5kj8        0/1     Completed   0          31s
redpanda-console-5d77c44b95-wf6kg   1/1     Running     0          31s
redpanda-post-upgrade-2l5xg         0/1     Completed   0          25s
```


To see an ingress endpoint installed, run:

```
kubectl -n redpanda get ingress
```{{exec}}


It should be bound to port 80.

```
NAME               CLASS    HOSTS   ADDRESS     PORTS   AGE
redpanda-console   <none>   *       localhost   80      26m
```


Give it a couple of minutes to start. (Refresh it if you see 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable. This is a very limited cluster.)

Click [Redpanda Console]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_80}}/) to access it in your browser.
